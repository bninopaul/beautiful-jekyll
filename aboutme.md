subtitle: Data Scientist/Solo Traveler
---

Hi! I'm Paul. I currently work as a data scientist in a healthcare company. In case you are wondering what kind of career is that, it is just a fancy term for a researcher! What we do is conduct data science projects that use machine learning, mathematics and statistics approach and sometimes from time to time data-engineering tasks to solve industry related problems, in my case, healthcare. Besides my career, I am also a solo traveler, I enjoy wandering around new places and trying out new things. 

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
