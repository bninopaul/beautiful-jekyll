Hi! I'm Paul. I currently work as a data scientist in a healthcare company. In case you are wondering what kind of career is that, it is just a fancy term for a researcher! What we do is conduct data science projects that use machine learning, mathematics and statistics approach and sometimes from time to time data-engineering tasks to solve industry related problems, in my case, healthcare. Data science is any methodology that uses/manipulates data to gather useful insights. Besides my career, I am also a solo traveler, I enjoy wandering around new places and trying out new things. 

This blog will contain mostly the things I learned in data science and probably my own little adventures in traveling or in life in general. I hope that sharing this will not only benefit me for personal documentation but also to those people who ended up in this page. Enjoy!
