## Problem 1

(Inference) The following data are an IID sample from a $Cauchy (\theta, 1)$ distribution: 1.77, -0.23, 2.76, 3.80, 3.47, 56.75, -1.34, 4.24, -2.44, 3.29, 3.71, -2.40, 4.53, -0.07, -1.05, -13.87, -2.53, -1.75, 0.27, 43.21.

a. Graph the log likelihood function.
b. Find the MLE for $\theta$ using the Halleyâ€™s method. Try the following starting points: -11, 0, 1.5, 4, 4.7, 7, 38, and 51. Consider also using the mean and median of the data as starting points.Discuss the results.
